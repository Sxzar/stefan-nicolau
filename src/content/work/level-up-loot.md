The UI/UX was fully designed in **Figma** to ensure a clean, user-friendly experience across all devices. [](https://www.figma.com/file/WjDYG9jQkVUC0Og0nQofTC/)

As both designer and full-stack developer, I built the site using **React** with **react-router-dom** for smooth navigation, **react-slick** for interactive carousels, and **react-mailchimp-subscribe** for the newsletter form. Game data is fetched from multiple APIs via RapidAPI, making the platform dynamic and always up to date.

To ensure top performance and accessibility, the site was optimized following best practices — scoring **99/100 in performance**, **93/100 in accessibility**, and **91/100 in SEO** in Google Lighthouse audits. It loads fast, works well across devices, and is easy to use even for casual visitors.\
