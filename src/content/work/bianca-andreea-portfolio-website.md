As the sole developer on a freelance contract, I was responsible for building the site from scratch, including **layout implementation**, **CMS setup**, **responsive behavior**, **accessibility**, and **performance tuning**. The website had to be easy to manage, visually clean, and technically solid across devices and screen sizes. 

The site was developed using **11ty (Eleventy)** as the static site generator, with templating powered by **Nunjucks** and styles written in **SCSS**. Content is managed via **Netlify CMS**, allowing Bianca to independently update her portfolio entries and blog posts without touching code.

**Key contributions:**

* **Complete Site Architecture:** Built the full site structure including homepage, project pages, blog, and contact form — using modular Nunjucks templates and reusable components.
* **CMS Configuration:** Designed a clean, maintainable content structure within Netlify CMS, enabling easy image uploads, project metadata editing, and blog management.
* **Image Optimization & Performance:** Utilized `sharp` to generate responsive image sizes, implemented lazy loading, Brotli compression, and `<picture>` elements to maintain fast load times.
* **Accessibility & SEO:** Refined semantic HTML structure and added ARIA attributes where needed; the site scores **96% accessibility** and **92% SEO** on Lighthouse.
* **Performance Tuning:** Scored **94% performance on mobile**, with careful SCSS optimization, unused CSS removal, and minimal JS.
* **Collaborative Design Execution:** Worked closely with Bianca on layout decisions and page structure based on her visual direction — resulting in a site that feels custom, intentional, and aligned with her branding.

The final website is live at [bianca-a.com](https://bianca-a.com) and has received highly positive feedback from Bianca’s clients. Since launch, she has signed several new clients and uses the site as her primary portfolio and outreach tool. The fast performance, strong visual layout, and CMS flexibility made it a successful, scalable foundation for her creative brand.
