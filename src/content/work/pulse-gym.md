I was brought in as a freelance developer to completely redesign and rebuild the website from the ground up. The goal was to modernize the brand’s online presence, drive new signups, make the site mobile-friendly, and empower the client to manage content on their own moving forward.

The site was rebuilt using **11ty (Eleventy)** for static performance, **Tailwind CSS + daisyUI** for styling, and **Decap CMS** to allow non-technical content management. I led every aspect of the build — from layout and animations to CMS configuration and performance optimization.

**Key contributions included:**

* **Complete Page Development:** Designed and implemented all core pages — including Homepage (with CTA-rich hero), Features, About, Trainers, Pricing Plans, and Contact.
* **Brand-Driven UI Execution:** Used a bold black base with hot pink and red accents to give the site a high-impact, motivational tone. All-caps condensed typography helped deliver an intense, no-nonsense message.
* **CMS Configuration with Decap:** Built flexible content collections for trainers, pricing plans, and feature blocks. The client can now manage team bios, images, and pricing updates directly from the CMS.
* **Modular, Symmetrical Layouts:** Applied a strict grid system with alternating color blocks to create visual rhythm and clarity across all sections — especially effective in presenting features and pricing tiers.
* **Performance & Accessibility:** Optimized images using `sharp` and WebP, applied lazy loading and semantic markup, and ensured ARIA roles and keyboard navigation support — all resulting in strong Lighthouse scores.
* **Custom Animations:** Implemented micro-animations and hover effects to enhance interactivity without compromising performance, using Tailwind transitions and minimal JS.

While the site is currently hosted as a **live demo** for portfolio continuity, the design and structure are fully client-ready. Feedback from test users and collaborators has been overwhelmingly positive, praising the “club-meets-training-ground” aesthetic and the ease of use across devices. The project is a strong demonstration of my ability to merge brand identity with modern frontend best practices in a highly structured, editable environment.
