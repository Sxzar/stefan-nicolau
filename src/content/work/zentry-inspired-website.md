description: >-
  **A responsive, animation-rich site built with Vite, React, TailwindCSS, and
  GSAP.**


  Inspired by the sleek, animated design of [Zentry,](https://zentry.com) I set out to challenge myself by replicating a similar high-end user experience. The goal was to improve my animation skills and learn to use GSAP for scroll-based interactions in a modern frontend stack.

My objective was to build a **fully responsive** web experience that featured **advanced scroll-triggered animations**, **geometric transitions**, and **seamless video integration** — closely mimicking the original design while developing reusable components and scalable structure.

I developed the project using **Vite** for fast builds, **React** with modular components, and **Tailwind CSS** for efficient styling using the OKLCH color model. For animations, I used **GSAP with ScrollTrigger** to animate elements on scroll and clip-path transitions. One of the main challenges was getting video playback to behave correctly on mobile devices without breaking the layout. I solved this by using the `playsInline` attribute and conditionally serving mobile-optimized video files. All animations were refined through careful experimentation and close reading of GSAP documentation.\
\
The result is a responsive, scroll-animated site that runs smoothly across devices. Despite using multiple animations and embedded videos, the project maintains a **96% performance score on Lighthouse**, with potential for even higher optimization if needed. Beyond refining my GSAP skillset, the project serves as a strong showcase piece for employers, highlighting both design sensitivity and frontend engineering skills.
