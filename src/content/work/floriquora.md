title: Floriquora
description: >-
  Floriquora is a boutique flower shop that needed an elegant, minimalist
  website to reflect its delicate, curated offerings. The goal was to create a
  romantic, modern space where customers could browse beautiful bouquets, read
  floral tips on a blog, and get in touch — without overwhelming them with the
  complexities of a full eCommerce system.


  The brand identity was rooted in **grace, softness, and personal touch**, targeting a mostly female audience seeking unique floral arrangements for intimate moments.
task: |-
  * Grid-based, soft design with romantic floral visuals
  * Handwritten script accents and serif/sans-serif font pairing
  * Static bouquet "favorites" feature via localStorage
  * Smart contact form autofills based on selected bouquet
  * Decap CMS for bouquet entries, categories, and blog content
  * Mailchimp-integrated newsletter signup
  * Blog-ready structure (non-wired in demo)
  * Fully responsive, WebP-optimized, and accessible

I was hired on a freelance contract to design and develop the website from scratch, including layout, CMS configuration, styling, and interaction logic. While the site mimics the behavior of an eCommerce platform, it’s actually a static build — optimized for speed, elegance, and easy content management via CMS.

\
The project was built using **11ty (Eleventy)** with **Nunjucks**, styled using **Tailwind CSS** and **daisyUI**, and powered by **Decap CMS** for content management. The design system prioritized white space, modular symmetry, floral illustration accents, and emotional UX flows.

Key contributions included:

Complete Page Design & Development: Built homepage, flower category pages, bouquet listings, contact form, and newsletter signup. Carefully structured sections to allow white space to balance image-heavy areas.

Soft UI Styling: Applied a muted pastel color palette with blush pinks, soft grays, and deep burgundy accents. Fonts included elegant serifs for headings, modern sans-serifs for body, and a handwritten script for logo and hero text to create a personal, emotional impression.

Favorites Functionality (Static Simulation): Implemented a front-end-only system to "favorite" bouquets, mimicking the behavior of an eCommerce wishlist using JavaScript and local storage — no backend required.

Contact Form with Pre-Filled Intent: Replaced traditional “Buy Now” functionality with a smart contact form trigger — the CTA autofills the form with a subject and message like:
Subject: Lilies
Message: Hello, I'm interested in the "Lilies". Could you provide some details on the features, pricing, and availability?
This lowers friction and makes the customer journey feel more guided and human.

CMS & Newsletter Integration: Connected Decap CMS for managing products, categories, and blog content. Newsletter signup was wired to Mailchimp, but built flexibly for future provider swaps.

Performance & Accessibility: Optimized images with sharp, converted to WebP, lazy-loaded visuals, used semantic HTML5, and ensured screen reader support.

The site also includes a blog section (disabled on the demo version), intended for floral tips, seasonal guides, and care instructions.\

While currently hosted as a demo version, Floriquora functions as a full-featured boutique florist site. The design has received praise from collaborators for its elegance, soft animations, and emotionally intelligent UX — including the non-intimidating inquiry form and wishlist simulation.
