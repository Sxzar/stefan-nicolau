I was hired as a freelance developer and designer to build the site from scratch, handling everything from UX/UI layout to CMS integration and performance tuning. The site had to deliver a sense of luxury and timelessness through its visuals, while remaining intuitive, responsive, and easy for the client to maintain over time.

The website was developed using **11ty (Eleventy)** with **Nunjucks templates** and styled using **Tailwind CSS** alongside **daisyUI** components. I also handled all **Decap CMS** configuration to allow the client to update content such as menu items, gallery photos, and contact details without developer intervention.

**Key contributions:**

* **Elegant Layout & Page Development:** Designed and implemented the full site, including Homepage, About, Menu, Gallery, and Contact — using a grid-based system and vintage-inspired type styles for a refined, editorial feel.
* **Custom CMS Configuration:** Structured Decap CMS content types to allow non-technical users to update the menu (with price fields, categories), upload gallery images, and edit business hours and contact info.
* **Performance & Image Optimization:** Used `sharp` for image processing, converted assets to **WebP**, and implemented lazy loading and responsive image sets for fast rendering without sacrificing quality.
* **SEO & Accessibility:** Built with semantic HTML5, added ARIA roles where necessary, and structured metadata and page content to support local SEO goals.
* **Design-Driven Execution:** Paid close attention to spacing, typography, and subtle transitions to give the site a luxurious look and feel. Fonts and colors were carefully chosen to echo the café's interior design.

While the site was initially built for the client, I deployed a **demo version** to ensure portfolio continuity in case the live deployment is ever taken down or modified.

The Cressavon site delivers a premium browsing experience that aligns beautifully with the café’s upscale image. Visitors can easily browse the menu, explore the space through a photo gallery, and find essential location and contact info. The content structure makes future updates simple and sustainable.
