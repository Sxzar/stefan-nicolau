I was hired as a freelance developer to bring the brand to life online, building a bold and responsive website from scratch. The goal was to showcase the menu, capture the vibe of a modern street-food brand, and make updates easy via a CMS. The site had to be fast, mobile-first, and designed to stand out in a crowded food scene. 

I built the site using **11ty (Eleventy)** with **Nunjucks templates**, styled with **Tailwind CSS** and **daisyUI**, and integrated **Decap CMS** for easy content management. The visual direction focused on high contrast, big type, and structured layout rhythms that reflect the energy of The Patty Wagon’s food and brand voice.

**Key contributions included:**

* **Visual System & Layouts:** Developed a modular page structure using alternating black/yellow sections for rhythm and clarity. All content was centered and structured for mobile-first consumption, with consistent iconography and stylized section headings like “01 Burgers” and “02 Dogs”.
* **Typography & Styling:** Implemented a bold all-caps heading system with strong sans-serif fonts to convey energy and confidence. Used custom Tailwind typography classes to keep styling scalable and readable.
* **Menu & CMS Integration:** Set up a clean CMS structure via Decap for easy editing of menu categories, pricing, and descriptions — empowering the client to update burgers, dogs, and sides without code.
* **Performance & Accessibility:** Optimized all assets with `sharp`, used semantic HTML5 and ARIA for accessibility, and implemented lazy loading for images. Achieved high scores in Lighthouse for performance, accessibility, and SEO.
* **Interactive Touches:** Subtle hover animations, interactive call-to-actions, and a contact form with clear validation helped complete the modern, fast-food-inspired web experience.

The Patty Wagon website captures the high-energy personality of the brand while staying technically robust and scalable. It successfully blends style and substance — delivering an eye-catching, user-friendly experience that’s fast, mobile-optimized, and easy to manage. A live demo is available to ensure its place in my portfolio regardless of future deployment changes.
